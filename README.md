# Chatbot for COVID19

This chatbot was created as part of the CodeVsCOVID19 Hackathon 27/03/2020 to 30/03/2020.
*Website*: https://www.codevscovid19.org

The goal of this non-profit online hackathon is to develop a technical open-source prototype that provides a solution to address challenges regarding COVID-19 within 72 hours.

## Problem Identification: ##
We chose to address the problem of overcrowded and pressured hospitals as a result of the COVID19 pandemic.

## Our Solution: ##
Create a robot that can perform daily tasks that include:
- Sanitize infected areas using UV light
- Automated detection of fever patients (e.g. with thermal camera)
- Automated patient monitoring (teleoperated by medical staff)
- Distribute hand sanitizer/masks

My role was to create a Chatbot that will ask specific symptom related questions. It would dictate questions and either take responses via voice or hand movement. Purpose is to reduce contact with the victims of the virus.
